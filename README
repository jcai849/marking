INSTRUCTIONS

First, navigate to the scripts directory. This is the main seat of operations.
Run 'init'.  Then, place the student submissions in a 'submissions' directory,
within the root marking directory.  Build all of the submissions with 'make
build' from within the scripts directory.  Mark the submissions with 'make
mark'.  Email the marking results with 'make email'.  All of the marks are in a
'marks' file in the root directory.

MECHANISM

A makefile controls the build. 'make build' produces, for every
(case-insensitive) Rmd file, the resulting output (forced to html) in a
'build-successful' directory. For the builds that fail, their Rmd files are
copied to a 'build-failure' directory. The original Rmd files are suffixed with
'.built', to indicate their state to make, thereby allowing all operations to
be idempotent.
