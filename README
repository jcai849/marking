INSTRUCTIONS

First, navigate to the scripts directory. This is the main seat of operations.
Run 'init'.  Then, place the student submissions in the newly generated
'submissions' directory, within the root marking directory.  Build all of the
submissions with 'make build' from within the scripts directory.  Mark the
submissions with 'make mark'.  Email the marking results with 'make email'
(assuming that you have the 'mail' program set up on your machine).  All of the
marks are in a 'marks' file in the root directory. The process can be stopped
and resumed at any point, and can include additional student submissions
midway, without requiring any restarts.

MECHANISM

A makefile controls the build. 'make build' attempts to generate an html file
for every (case-insensitive) Rmd file. If successful, the html file is sent to
the 'build-successful' directory. In the case of failure to compile, the faulty
Rmd files are copied to a 'build-failure' directory. All of the original Rmd
files are suffixed with '.built', to indicate their state to the make process,
thereby allowing all operations to be idempotent.
