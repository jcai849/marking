FUNCTIONALITY

The 'build' component, and the 'init' and 'summarise' scripts are functional.

INSTRUCTIONS

First, ensure that all submissions are named as *.rmd. This means extracting
all tarballs etc.

Navigate to the scripts directory. This is the main seat of operations.  Run
'init'. Then, place the student submissions in the newly generated
'submissions' directory, within the root marking directory. Build all of the
submissions with 'make build' from within the scripts directory. Mark the
submissions with 'make mark'. Email the marking results with 'make email'
(assuming that you have the 'mail' program set up on your machine). Summarise
the marks with 'summarise', taking the name of the marks file as argument. The
process can be stopped and resumed at any point, and can include additional
student submissions midway, without requiring any restarts.

MECHANISM

A makefile controls the operation, calling shell scripts to perform each
operation.

'make build' calls the 'build' shell script to generate an html file for every
(case-insensitive) Rmd file, with a given timeout. If successful, the html file
is sent to the 'output' directory.  In the case of failure to compile within
the time limit, a log of stderr is recorded in the basename of the Rmd file in
the 'logs' directory. All of the original Rmd files have their suffixes changed
to either '.buildsuccess' or '.buildfailure', to indicate their state to the
make process, thereby allowing all operations to be idempotent.
